This is a simple boiler plate for a Blog developed in React. It uses React States, React Hooks and React Router. It should also provide an insight how data can be used from a JSON format.
  
This project should help you understand the basic folder and file structure for a React project. Please feel free to use the template to build your own Blog App and add more features to it.
  
  
This is not using any styling libraries like Boottsrap or Material UI. This was done solely to help one understand the basic principles of React and how you can manage link between multiple pages using 'React Router' and 'React Hooks'.
